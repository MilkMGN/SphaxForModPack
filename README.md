# SphaxForModPack

A collection of textures for my modpack [found here](https://github.com/MilkMGN/MCModPack)

to apply, just drag either the manual patch folder or the automatic patch folder into `.minecraft/resourcepacks`. if you dont know which to choose, look below.

auto patch applies every texture in the pack in one simple pack, and manual patch applies each texture seperately, good if you have multiple texture packs and want to choose.

**REMEMBER YOU NEED TO GO INTO THE FOLDER AND COPY THAT, NOT THE AUTO/MANUAL PATCH FOLDER.**
